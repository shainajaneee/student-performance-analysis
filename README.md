# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student performance using a dataset of student attributes and grades. The goal is to understand which factors most influence whether a student passes or fails, and to visualize the results using clear charts.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Overview of the dataset, including student demographics and academic info.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Logistic Regression to predict student pass/fail outcomes.
- **Key Visualizations:**
  1. **Top Features Influencing Pass/Fail:** Logistic Regression coefficients showing which factors increase or decrease the likelihood of passing.
  2. **Confusion Matrix:** Model predictions vs actual outcomes to evaluate performance.
  3. **Pass vs Fail Distribution:** Shows the balance of pass/fail in the dataset.
